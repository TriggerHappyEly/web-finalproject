				<p>from YYZFRANK</p>
				<blockquote><p>Decided to stop by this place after we came to casino Rama I got to say
				it's one of the best cigar stores I've ever been to in Canada. Very friendly and 
				knowledgeable staff and one of the biggest cigar selections I've ever seen fairly 
				priced as well got a complimentary cigar puncher which was nice</p></blockquote>

				<p>from Spike Barkshire</p>
				<blockquote><p>I love Casa delicious Humidor! I mean. How could you not? The guys
				in there are very knowledgeable and friendly.  Ready to answer your questions(and you
				will have some). The walk in humidor has thousands or cigars just waiting(for not a very
				long time I might add) to be taken home. If you love a good cigar as much as I do. It is
				a must stop.</p></blockquote>

				<blockquote><p>What a terrific place. The selection of cigars is staggering, and perfect
				quality. Very friendly and helpful staff. We visited a few times during our vacation and
				came away with a few more cigars each time. We will be coming back again</p></blockquote>
